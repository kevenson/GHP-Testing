2. The time-dependent Schroedinger equation (TDSE) describes the time evolution of a quantum state. The equation in analytic form is

    $$
       \hat{H}\Psi = i \hbar\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial t}
    $$

    where $$\hat{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator---the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system.  It is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators.  The TDSE is analogous to an equation of motion encountered in classical systems.
    
3. A vector (or function)...
